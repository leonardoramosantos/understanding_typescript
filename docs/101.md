# Typescript 101

Typescript is a Superset of javascript.
It's a compiler of typescript to javascript. You get all the advantages of typescript and it generates javascript code to run on Node.

It rounds about having types of data, possibly finding errors early on development comparing with javascript.

example javascript:
------
function add(num1, num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
}

# Instead of concatenating two numbers, it will concatenate two strings
console.log(add('2', '3'))
------

example typescript:
------
function

## Default Typescript Types

Typescript by default provides some types to use:

- `number`: All numbers, integer, negative numbers and floating numbers
- `string`: All text values
- `boolean`: Only `true` and `false`
- `object`: Any javascript object and more specific typescript object types
- `Array`: Any javascript array and the array can be flexible or script typed
- `Tuple`: Only typescript has it. It's an array with fixed length
- `Enum`: Only typescript has it. enumerated global constant identifiers
- `Any`: Any kind of value
- `Union`: You can have a var with one or more types (number | string). you have to test the data type before process it
- `Literal Types`: You can specify the value of a given data
- `Function`: You describe a type of a Function
- `unknown`: Used when we still don't know the type of data when it is created and forces a typecasting or validation
- `never`: Used when a function must throw an error
